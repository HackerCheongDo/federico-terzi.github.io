<p>For my Computer Engineering degree, I developed a <b>Gesture Recognition System</b> 
and my thesis was focused on the research of the right Machine Learning algorithms, 
the creation of the motion tracking devices and the design of a fully custumizable modular system.
</p>
<p>The thesis is written in Italian and called "<i>Sviluppo di un sistema di Gesture Recognition</i>".</p>
