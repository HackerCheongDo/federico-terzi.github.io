The *Gesture Keyboard* is a device capable of converting gestures into characters, made using an Arduino.

That makes possible writing as you would normally do with a keyboard, by moving the device in the air.

Technologies used:

* **Arduino**, to build the device that records the movements.
* **Python**, to make the library capable of converting movements into characters
* **Scikit-learn**, a python machine learning library.
