Like many people, I wasn’t a good typer. I started using computers when I was a kid and, by the time I grew into an adult, I developed my personal typing style, using *only 5 fingers*.

Surprisingly, the biggest problem wasn’t the speed ( I achieved about 56 words per minute, an average speed ) but the *wrist movements* I had to make. Other than being very inefficient, that would have probably caused me **pain** in the long run.

So about a year ago, I decided to relearn how to type **properly**, embracing the [Touch Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) technique.

### Learning Touch Typing

The first thing I did was **printing a keyboard layout diagram and sticking it on my monitor**, so each time I had a doubt, I could check the correct finger at a glance by watching the color.

At the same time, I started practicing on [10 Fast Fingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) and [Speedcoder](http://www.speedcoder.net) about 20 minutes a day.

But the most important thing I did was to **force myself to write properly from that moment on**, even if it was difficult. And for the first week, it was very difficult. 

I started tracking my progress and after about 2 weeks I was achieving the same speed as my old method. Then, as time went on, my fluency kept improving, as you can tell from this graph:

After 2 months **I was comfortable with touch typing**, my speed greatly improved and I was ready for the next step:

### Moving to the US Keyboard layout

If you live in the US this may sound obvious to you, but **the English US Keyboard Layout is the best for programming**. Why? Because the people how invented most programming languages used that layout.

Being Italian, I always used the Italian layout and, while the letters and digits were arranged in the same way as the US layout (QWERTY), the symbols were not. **Most of the symbols commonly used in programming were difficult**, if not impossible, to write on an Italian keyboard ( looking at you ~ ).

So I decided to learn the US layout by using the same approach as before: stick a layout picture on my monitor, practicing on training websites and forcing myself to type with it.

### Conclusions

After more than a year of touch typing on the US layout, I can say that **my overall productivity increased a lot**. Programming and other tasks, like using the terminal, are now a smoother experience.

Of course, living in a non-English country, I still need to type with the Italian layout sometimes. Luckily for me, most operating systems offer a **quick shortcut to switch between layouts** ( For example Win+Space on Windows ).

For those of you who are considering if learning how to type properly is worth it or not: **do it, it takes a little effort, but the reward is huge**.

PS: There are some other super-advanced layouts out there ( like Colemak and Dvorak ), but I’m not ready for those yet :)
