    <p>Books an incredible resource to learn new concepts in a coherent way, to broaden point of views or simply to relax. </p>
    <p>Here's a list of the ones I recommend (most recently read at the top):</p>

    <ul class="book-list">
    {% assign reverseBooks = site.data.books | reverse %}
    {% for book in reverseBooks %}
    <li><i><a href="{{book.link}}" target="_blank">{{book.name}}</a></i> by {{book.author}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
